# FirstWebsite
This is a site that I've created using HTML (and little to no CSS) after completing a basic HTML.

Site version 1.0.
You can download the .zip file and open index.html (which would be the front page), or review the code within the .html files from GitHub directly.

Note: I plan on continue learning CSS and JavaScript to make a more interactive, nicer site.
