# FirstWebsite
This is a site that I've created using HTML (and little to no CSS) after completing a basic HTML.
Important: Open in Chrome. (I saw some problems from Edge and my cellphone's native browser.. mainly the CSS is not loading afaik).

(CURRENT) Site version 1.01.
-Removed stylying from the HTML files and passed it to an independant CSS file.
You can download the .zip file and open index.html (which would be the front page), or review the code within the .css and .html files from GitHub directly.
